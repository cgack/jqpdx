jQuery Mobile has amazing cross-device and cross-browser compatibility, lending a native feel to many mobile browsing experiences. 
Sometimes you want your awesome jQuery Mobile application to be downloadable from a native app store, for these times you turn to Phonegap. 
In this talk I will discuss everything from how to setup a jQuery Mobile application with Phonegap to not only make the application feel native, but also will show how implementing the native functionality that comes with Phonegap can fit easily and seamlessly into your jQuery Mobile application. 
Along the way we'll discuss Remote debugging techniques as well as some gotchas, such as iOS URL whitelisting, and how to programatically allow for opening URLs outside of your WebView.
